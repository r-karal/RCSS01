##Problem Statement

Despite increasing awareness about investing, most students lack practical exposure to the stock market. Fear of losing real money, low financial literacy, emotional trading, and complex trading platforms prevent beginners from learning how markets actually work. There is no safe, engaging, and student-focused platform where learners can practice trading, understand risk, and build confidence without financial loss.


---

##Proposed Solution

Tradeo is a Gamified Virtual Trading League for Students that allows users to trade stocks using virtual money in a simulated real-market environment. Students can participate in compete with peers, track performance through leaderboards, and earn acheivements and rewards. The platform combines learning with gamification, helping users understand trading concepts, and portfolio diversification in a fun and safe way.
